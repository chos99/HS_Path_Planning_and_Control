function splin = mbc_spline_create(track, dx, alpha)
% splin = mbc_spline_create(track, dx, alpha) interpolates track by
% spline.
%
%   track - track including path segments
%   dx - step size of arc length for interpolation point calculation [ m ]
%   alpha - position on track [ -1; 1 ]
%   splin - struct containing the track spline, its first and second
%          derivative.
%
%   Each spline in this struct is a two-dimensional piecewise polynomial.
%   One polynomial for the x-position and on for the y-position.
%   All polynomials are parameterized by the arc length.
%
%   If alpha == 0 then the right line points are generated.
%   If alpha == 0.5 then the center line points are generated.
%   If alpha == 1 then the left line points are generated.
%
% mbc_spline_create uses csape (part of the Curve Fitting Toolbox)
% to create a periodic spline for periodic tracks. If no Curve Fitting
% Toolbox is available spline is used instead of csape. But spline
% is not really useful for periodic tracks.
%
% See also csape, spline.
