% w  = mbc_spline_get_reference(s, breakslen, points, ppcoefs, ...
%      periodic, vref, Tt) calculates the reference signal for
%      path following control.
%
%   s - current car position: vector with x- and y-coordinates
%   breakslen - number of breaks
%   points - interpolation points on spline. 3 x n matrix.
%            points(1,:) is the discrete arc length.
%            points(2,:) are the x-coordinates (s1).
%            points(3,:) are the y-coordinates (s2).
%   ppcoefs - piecewise polynomial coefficients of path
%   periodic - true if circular track, false otherwise
%   vref - speed for lookahead
%   Tt - steering delay for lookahead of kappa
%   w - reference signal: [ arc length x, orientation angle psi [rad],
%       s1, s2, curvature kappa ]
%   widx - index nearest point in spline
