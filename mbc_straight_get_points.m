function [ points ] = mbc_straight_get_points(track, idx, xstart, dx, alpha)
% points = mbc_straight_get_points(track, idx, sstart, ds, alpha)
% computes the accurate line points on the track segment.
%
%   track - track object
%   idx - the index of the track segment
%   xstart - the arc length of the segment start positon [ m ]
%   dx - the arc distance of two neighbor points [ m ]
%   alpha - the line position on the road [ 0 ; 1 ]
%   points - the points as a 3 x n matrix
%
%   points(1, :) is the arc length at each point
%   points(2, :) is the x position
%   points(3, :) is the y position
%
%   If alpha == 0 then the right line points are generated.
%   If alpha == 0.5 then the center line points are generated.
%   If alpha == 1 then the left line points are generated.
